Anaconda

Add Anaconda 3 to the system PATH environment variable.

This "add to PATH" option makes Anaconda get found before previously installed software, but may cause problems requiring you to uninstall and reinstall Anaconda.

INSTEAD
Open Anaconda3 with the Windows Start menu and select "Anaconda(64-bit)".
